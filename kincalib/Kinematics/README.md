# Tested kinematic models

Two equivalent kinematic models for a PSM with large needle driver are provided in this module. Depending on the parameters of the model it is possible to model both a classic (400006) and SI (420006)  large needle driver.

1. Kinematic model from the surgical robotics challenge.
